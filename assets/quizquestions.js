        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Banks don't offer unsecured loans via unsolicited calls or ask for upfront fees. This is a loan scam. Legitimate banks assess your creditworthiness and never demand money before approval."

        options: ["Legitimate prize", "Advance-Fee Lottery Scam", "Real win"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "You cannot win a lottery you never entered. Legitimate lotteries never ask winners to pay fees to claim prizes. This is an advance-fee scam designed to steal your money."

        correct: 1,
        explanation: "If it promises quick money with little work, it's likely a pyramid or MLM scam. They make money from recruiting, not actual products. You'll lose money. Avoid schemes promising unrealistic returns."
